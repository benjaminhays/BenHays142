I'm currently a full-time high school student in the USA, but I make time for studying computer science in my down-time.

Sec+ and CCNA holder, currently working on CCNP Security. 

The code for my website and a few of my other projects is available at [git.benhays.org](https://git.benhays.org)

If you need to reach out or just have a quick convo, you can reach me by email: ben@benhays.org
